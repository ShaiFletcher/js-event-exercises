      <h3>Sun</h3>
      <button class="remove-button">[x]</button>
      <p>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly as visible light and infrared radiation. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometres (864,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, and accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. Roughly three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.</p>

      <h3>Moon</h3>
      <button class="remove-button">[x]</button>
      <p>The Moon is Earth's only proper natural satellite. It is one quarter the diameter of Earth (comparable to the width of Australia) making it the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet. It is the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System and is larger than any dwarf planet. The Moon orbits Earth at an average lunar distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), or 1.28 light-seconds. Its gravitational influence produces Earth's tides and slightly lengthens Earth's day. It is considered a planetary-mass moon and a differentiated rocky body; its surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's (0.1654 g) and it lacks any significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field. Jupiter's moon Io is the only satellite in the Solar System known to have a higher surface gravity and density.</p>

      <h3>Mars</h3>
      <button class="remove-button">[x]</button>
      <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red Planet". The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, with surface features reminiscent of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts and polar ice caps of Earth.
